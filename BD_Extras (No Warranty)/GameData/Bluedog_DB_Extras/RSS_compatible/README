This module manager mod for Bluedog Design Bureau aims to make the BDB rockets
useable in the Real Solar System in the simplest way possible.

It does not aim to be realistic so it's not intented to be used with the
realism overhaul.

What is does:
The mod will simple upgrade all BDB engines and RCS thrusters by increasing
Their max. thrust and doubling their ISP.
What this does is give them more thrust to get off the ground (duh) and make
the engines (unrealistically) more efficient so they get double the DeltaV
out of the same fueltank.
This will allow rockets build with BDB parts to achieve orbit in RSS.
