All files in the BD_Extras folders are provided WITHOUT WARRANTY.

Simply put, if you don't understand EXACTLY what something in this folder does, DON'T INSTALL IT.



The BD_Extras folder is not an expansion to the mod. It is a place to collect patches that users have made for their own use, and kindly have allowed us to keep them on the Github so that other users can use them.



The RealNames config is fairly harmless. It changes the names of all the BDB parts to realistic names, and was exhaustively researched by IronCretin.

Pafftek includes modified configs to create new parts using existing models. Engine variants that would be superfluous in the main mod, but do add more options for gameplay.

The Saturn Rescale config increases the size of the Saturn parts to properly scale them for KSP. It makes the Saturn V 6.25m and the S-IVB 4.25m.
